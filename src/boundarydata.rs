// this is where the code for producing boundary data will be stored 
// as well as high quality precalculated data to be imported for speed 

// should we have a class for boundary data which all the functions run off of
// i think that would be pretty useful


// need to have a new class for boundary data


// square functions 
pub fn square_points() {


}

pub fn square_normals() {

    
}

pub fn square_weights() {

    
}
// require this sequence for different shapes



// construct data takes a string argument and number of evaluation points and then produces the boundary data for that
pub fn construct_data() {


}



// here we'll have some example data to call in the main function as const for speed
